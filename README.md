# Simple Counter

## Project Description
**Simple Counter** is a single-page application that provides a basic counter functionality. Users can increment or decrement the counter value displayed on the page. Built using jQuery, this application is a great way to learn about DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features
- Displays the current counter value, starting from 0.
- Two interactive buttons for incrementing and decrementing the counter.
- Responsive design compatible with modern web browsers.
- Utilizes jQuery for efficient DOM manipulations.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Simple Counter application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-counter.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd simple-counter
   ```

3. **Open the HTML file:**
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

4. **Ensure Internet Connectivity:**
   The application loads jQuery from an official CDN, so ensure you have an active internet connection.

## Usage
- Open the application in your web browser. 
- You will see a counter value displayed on the page.
- Click the **Increment** button to increase the counter by 1.
- Click the **Decrement** button to decrease the counter by 1.

## Code Explanation
The application consists of a simple HTML structure containing:
- A display element with the id `#counter-value` that shows the current value of the counter.
- Two buttons with ids `#increment-btn` and `#decrement-btn` for user interactions.
- jQuery is loaded from a CDN to handle click events on the buttons and modify the counter value accordingly.

The core functionality relies on setting up click event listeners that update the counter value based on user input.
